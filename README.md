# Leaderboard
 A Leaderboard System that saves data using JSON instead of PlayerPrefs. Supports score submission with name input, duplicate name filtering with score replacement (only if higher), and displays the top 10 high scores. Includes a utility to generate dummy leaderboard entries for testing.
